# Phase 3 – Cycle 1 Review (Lesson #1)

**Date:** 7 November 2025
**Owner:** stephan-adod
**Cycle Window:** 24 October – 7 November 2025 (Phase 3 – Stabilization)

## Summary
- Cycle 1 completed with a focus on establishing baseline routines and rhythm.
- Health Score held steady at approximately **0.55**, confirming the expected baseline with no need for escalation.
- Preparation activities for the review (Task `T-2025-10-24-04`) concluded and evidence linked for archival.

## Observations
1. Daily standups were executed consistently, improving shared situational awareness.
2. Work-in-progress (WIP) limits were trialed but require clearer ownership to stick.
3. Documentation cadence improved once the lesson template was finalized.

## Frictions & Risks
- **Rhythm variability:** Afternoon hand-offs slipped twice; we need an automated reminder to reinforce the schedule.
- **Dependency tracking:** External vendor deliverable remains unconfirmed; integration planning blocked pending confirmation.
- **Context switching:** Owner load peaked mid-cycle, causing delays on non-critical analytics work.

## Decisions & Actions
- Establish a simple checklist for end-of-day rhythm until automation is available.
- Log vendor dependency updates in the shared tracker with a 48h follow-up expectation.
- Move low-priority analytics exploration to Cycle 2 backlog.

## Focus for Cycle 2 (08 – 21 November 2025)
- Reinforce **Routine & Rhythm** by automating reminders and enforcing WIP limits.
- Validate vendor commitment dates before sprint midpoint.
- Expand lesson template to capture explicit success criteria per cycle.

## Evidence
- Task closure: `T-2025-10-24-04` – Cycle 1 Review Preparation.
- Supporting artefacts retained in `artefacts/` per governance checklist.

## Notes
- Next review scheduled for 21 November 2025 with emphasis on momentum tracking.
- No additional health alerts triggered; baseline remains acceptable.
